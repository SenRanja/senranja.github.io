My blog has hybrid contents in English and Chinese, I prefer using English more in the future, especially Math and Commupter Technical fields. Sometimes I would write some trivia articles, such as reading notes, viewing notes of some daily events, films and novels, all these trivias may be in Chinese. If you have challenges reading existed Chinese compositions, please **right-click the page and translate the Chinese portion into English**. And notice notably and honestly, I appreciate critiques constructively from peers for progress with gratitude. Please leave your sugesstion and deep analysis! ^_^ Just log in github account and comment below my compositions, and then I would receive notice emails from github.

Recently I just thought, I cannot always write too fundamental blog articles, because maybe many people would feel tedious and exhausted by reading too detailed articles. So I determined to sort out and integrate many unnecessary and too detailed articles into some specific big articles, and then I would display new interesting solution articles at easy reading positions.

With respect of **Mathematics**, I put the Math directory as the first directory.

This blog theme uses Hexo, and it is built on Git Page. The specific theme is **3-hexo**. If you want to mimic the blog, please refer [hexo-theme-3-hexo](https://github.com/yelog/hexo-theme-3-hexo) and [3-hexo-instruction](https://yelog.org/2017/03/23/3-hexo-instruction/).
