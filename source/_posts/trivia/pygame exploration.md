Sometimes I think interests can motivate programmers to explore new techniques and keep the enthusiam to optimise current workout. So last week I researched pygame and just had a little try to use it, unfortunately I found it is not such useful frames. I think as a new learner, you may heard Django, Flask and Pygame, because they are popular framework by Python. But eventually, I need to say, pygame is not such useful and interesting as Django.

What I learned are from these sources:

    https://github.com/pygame/pygame

    https://www.pygame.org/docs/

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=636s

I run some codes of pygame, and the conclusion:

1. It cannot produce a little tremendous or remarkable games, such as Red alert. It can only basicly produce too simple little games, and I think its maxmium limit is Metal Slug, such as the reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnKocNdF9-U . If you want to develop great ideas and games, some famous gaming engines are recommanded.
   
2. It cannot be used in Scientific calculation and visibility. It can show picture clearly, but many lines, curves, arcs, texts are too pixel. If you use pygame to draw some graphs or charts, the workout could be much ambiguous with out precision.

3. It is weak in building and compilation. I often see others use Pyinstaller(the file size could be too big normally) to compile the source codes into an execution file. As a frame of game, it lacks the transplatforms functions.

Of course, if you want to make GalGame(My friend's idea, not mine), I think pygame is suitable, it can simply load images, audio and video, you can use the collision feature to realize your ideas rapidly, but how to generate your ideal images would be a challange.

Totally, when talking about games, my friends and classmates rarely use pygame, and I agree it may have little useful and amazing functions.
